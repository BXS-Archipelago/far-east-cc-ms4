# Milestone Project 4 : Far East Car Care Ltd, an online shopping site proposal for car-care products.

### By: Brian Smyth

## Why should this website exist?

Car care is a strongly growing business at present with a large pool of car enthusiasts as the primary customers, along with a smaller pool of car-care professionals who use products daily. This aspect of the business is strongly both visual and kinesthetic. To elaborate on this, car enthusiasts love beautiful looking cars, it appeals to their visual senses and emotions. Most also enjoy working on their own cars, putting great efforts into mechanical maintenance and care/appearance maintenance. The result is appreciated far more than the personal effort. 

While there are a lot of brands and products available, the most advanced ranges come from the Far East. There is a greater access to industrial grade chemicals from a broader field of innovation, which is pipelined into the automotive product sector. Their products are easier to use, more durable and look better than most European or American brands. The greatest obstacle to the car enthusiast based in Europe or USA is that they can't speak nor read Japanese, so the translation of product labels provides a huge barrier to purchasing. 

Too make it easier for the average enthusiast, this website will provide easy access to a range of Japanese car products which are of high quality and easily understood in their purpose. The website will be mainly a business-to-consumer website with an easy to follow categorisation of products. Users will be easily able to browse and select products by adding them to a shopping cart where they can then make a credit-card purchase through a secure online-purchase resource. The products will then be dispatched within 24 hours. 

Ancillary objectives for the site owners will be to offer an email subscription service with tips and tricks for product use, special offers and a feature for new/coming-soon product developments. 

## Strategic approach for the site's User Experience: 

The site will entice the users by showing video and images of cars which have had the products used on them. First and foremost, there must be visual appeal set apart from the actual product images in the store, which are attractive but are not particularly appealing due to the language differences in the labelling.

Upon landing on the index page, a small background video will play of a glossy prestige car. The Call-To-Action will be an eye-catching button to go straight to the store if desired. 

Adjuvant site pages will be the About page, the Frequently Asked Questions, and the Subscription/Contact page.

Site Navigation will be through a side-sliding menu on the left. The Icon actuator will be clearly at the top right of the page for the user to click on.

On mobile view, the icon will be at the top right for thumb-actuation since most people are right handed in holding their devices. The menu will again slide from the left for link-selection with left hand. 

## Who are the target Users?

 - The natural funneling within the true hands-on car-enthusiast groupage is probably more than 90% male (from experience, with no official data recorded that can be found). 
 - The target age-group for customers of the website is 18 to 70 years old as car lovers always enjoy working on their cars, regardless.
 - Car Wax Enthusiasts, who are actually a subset of car enthusiasts with large collections of car care products in their garages.
 - Detailing & Car Care Hobbyists - those who spend their weekends cleaning and polishing their family's and friend's cars for extra income. 
 - Average Car Owners, the owners who prefer to wash and wax their own cars without necessarily being enthusiastic about the engine or performance. 
 - Car Detailing & Valeting Professionals who use quality products on their clients' cars. 
 - Motorcycle Enthusiasts, as they also like to keep their bikes pristine.
 - Truck Enthusiasts.
 - Spouses and Relatives of Car Enthusiasts. 
 
## Research 

- There are a handful of small business who sell a broad range of car care products online.
- There are also larger Bulk chemical companies who specialise in car trade product sales, for dealers and car-wash centres, etc.
- There is a very small supply of Japanese products and some of these are low quality. 
- Most car owners are ignorant of car care products, the quality of them and what they are actually designed to do. 
- Most products are bought in general because of the marketing and merchandising on chain-store shelves. 
- Most products are bought because they are cheap.
- Car enthusiasts are more likely to discuss and compare products at social gatherings, car club meets, car shows. 
- Enthusiasts will share photos of their cars and product purchases on Social Media.
- Ease-of-use and the finish delivered by the product are more important than competitive pricing.
