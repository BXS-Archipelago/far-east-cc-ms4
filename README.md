## Introduction : Why should this website exist?

Car care is a strongly growing business at present with a large pool of car enthusiasts as the primary customers, along with a smaller pool of car-care professionals who use products daily. This aspect of the business is strongly both visual and kinesthetic. To elaborate on this, car enthusiasts love beautiful looking cars, it appeals to their visual senses and emotions. Most also enjoy working on their own cars, putting great efforts into mechanical maintenance and care/appearance maintenance. The result is appreciated far more than the personal effort. 

While there are a lot of brands and products available, the most advanced ranges come from the Far East. There is a greater access to industrial grade chemicals from a broader field of innovation, which is pipelined into the automotive product sector. Their products are easier to use, more durable and look better than most European or American brands. The greatest obstacle to the car enthusiast based in Europe or USA is that they can't speak nor read Japanese, so the translation of product labels provides a huge barrier to purchasing. 

Too make it easier for the average enthusiast, this website will provide easy access to a range of Japanese car products which are of high quality and easily understood in their purpose. The website will be mainly a business-to-consumer website with an easy to follow categorisation of products. Users will be easily able to browse and select products by adding them to a shopping cart where they can then make a credit-card purchase through a secure online-purchase resource. The products will then be dispatched within 24 hours. 

Ancillary objectives for the site owners will be to offer an email subscription service with tips and tricks for product use, special offers and a feature for new/coming-soon product developments. 

# UX

## UX : The Strategic approach for the site's User Experience: 

The site will entice the users through educational and instructional blog posts along with images of cars that have the site's products used on them. First and foremost, there must be both visual and educational appeal set apart from the actual products in the store. 

Upon landing on the index page, the user will be introduced with an attractive car image at the top, along with some featured blog posts in the main body of the page. There will be links to the store both in the body and at both the top navigation bar and the always-present sliding side navigation. 

Adjuvant site pages will be the Blog and posts pages, the About page, the Frequently Asked Questions, and the Contact page.

Site Navigation will be through a side-sliding menu on the left. The Icon actuator will be clearly visible at the top right of the page for the user to click on.

On mobile devices, the sliding navigation bar will the main tool for traversing the site, however the account button (to login or register) and the cart will always be available in the top right of every device.

## Who are the target Users?

- Car Enthusiasts. 
- The target age-group for customers of the website is 18 to 70 years old as car lovers always enjoy working on their cars, regardless.

# Scope

## Scope of Attributes of the website
 
- Fully controlled user accounts with Username and Password access only.
- Credit Card payment system facilitated by Stripe.
- Presentation of products in a structured fashion with facility to grow the range easily.
- The site will offer a Client feedback and rating system for products and in the Blog.
- Client-specific profile pages with history or transactions are available to registered users. They can update personal data or passwords. 
- The site templates and structure will be underpinned by the Django framework.
- The Databases required will be hosted on Heroku using Heroku Postgres for accessibility. 

## Structure and Layout of the site

- The site is formed with two predetermined factors for the user. 
    - The Content
    - The Navigation of the Content

<details>
<summary>Landing Page</summary>

![Layout](media/project_media/layout.jpg)
</details>


### Navigating the pages
The Navigation in large screen can be accomplished using either the top menu or the sliding side menu. The side menu is available even when scrolling farther down a page. The site can be navigated by unregistered viewers who can read the blogs or browse the product range. Some services are unavailable to unregistered users though, such as commenting on blog posts or actually purchasing products. Any attempt to do so will redirect them to the login page, where if necessary they can choose to register. 

#### Navigating the Blog 
- Users can search the blog from the Blog list page very easily.  Where a keyword may be present in both the title and the content of the blog, the search result will only return unique pages in the list. 
- The landing page, below the top hero-image, will hold the three featured blogs for the site in mid-page, depending on current marketing campaigns. Toward the end of the page, the latest three blog posts will be listed for people who may have already read the featured posts. 
- The blog list will contain paginated lists of the blog posts. There will be four per page, but a side-column will always show the latest posts as well as the blog search-bar.
- Each blog post will contain a Previous and Next post button with the title of the Post.  
- If not logged in, the visitor will be invited to log in and comment. They can follow through to register from this process easily.  


#### Navigating the Store
- From the landing page, users can initially use the top navigation bar for the store. There is a store search-bar for products only. There is also a navigation link for either  either a hover-on drop-down menu containing three rows of categories to select from, along with a "special offer" product.  Clicking on the Store link will take the user to the all products page with a menu of categories at the top. The first two columns contain the lists of possible product categories, the third column will display which current category the user is browsing in. The drop-down menu is available for medium and large screens, the on-screen categories will be used when viewing in smaller screen sizes. 

#### Store Layout
- In the Products page, each product is listed on a card with 
    - Image, 
    - Product name, 
    - Price,
    - Category 

- Clicking on the desired product shows the product detail; 
    - Image, 
    - Product name, 
    - Price,
    - Category 
    - Average Rating
    - Rate Now Button

 The Product detail will show that the product has achieved an average score of X out of Y reviews. Beneath the product details is the Reviews area where previous clients have left a comment and their own rating on the product.
- To leave a comment and score, the user must have registered and logged in.
- To Add To Cart, the user must also have registered and logged in. They will be directed to do so as the comment or purchase buttons will not be available at this point. 

#### Cart Page
- The cart will list all products selected for purchase. 
- Information displayed will be:
    - Image, 
    - Product name, 
    - Price,
    - Quantity with increment and decrement adjustment
    - Update (save changes) button
    - Delete item button
    - Line Total

The Cart Summary will also display:
    - Subtotal
    - Delivery Charge
    - Grand Total
    - Customer note - If they have not spent more than €50, it will display how much more to spend to reach free delivery threshold
    - Return to Store button
    - Proceed to Checkout Button

#### Allauth
The authentication package used to run the client registration package is Django-Allauth. This addresses authentication, registration, account management with the potential to add 3rd Party Social Media account authentication. At this point the Social Media aspect has not been integrated. Allauth will allow users to change and/or recover passwords, update email addresses and update personal profile information.


#### Checkout Page
The Checkout page will display
    - Delivery Address
    - Any new delivery information can be saved permanently with tickbox
    - Credit Card details request
    - Total to be charged to card

#### STRIPE Payments Facility and Developers tools
The checkout uses Stripe payments for credit card payments. To test the system, the company has provided the following for testing environment
    - Card number 4242 4242 4242 4242
    - Expiry date any future time
    - CVC any 3 digit number

#### Order Success
- Once the user has placed the order, details are received by Stripe for processing and a confirmation will be received by return. 
- Confirmation is sent to the users Email address and is also saved into their Order History section in their Account Profile



## Navigating the Blog
- The main ambit of the Blog section is to provide clients with instructional and semi-technical information regarding the products. Car enthusiasts always appreciate user guides written by knowledgeable, trusted and experienced technicians. The blog entries will reveal industry-insider tips and tricks about how to care for the car and this will appeal to both enthusiasts and professionals with a view or even a strong bias towards the products that can be purchased in the store area. 

- The blog is the main tool for marketing, supported by publishing to social media and email campaigns in the regular Subscription service. Featured blogs are available on the landing page with further links to the most recently published posts also available. 

- Each blog has data attached for metrics. 
    - Author (with avatar)
    - Number of Views
    - Number of Comments
    - Time since the article was published

### Creating Blog Posts

For attractive blog posts, TinyMCE, a third party Rich Text Editor plug in for the Content body of the blog. I installed this to allow for nicer options for formats of text and inserting images into blog posts. Once installed, the project URL and settings files are updated to integrate the editor. Please see the project's build-record.txt file, chapter 53 for details. 


## Database Resources

For hosting Media and Static CSS and Javascript sheets, Amazon Web Services AWS S3 bucket repositories were used. 
Heroku PostgreSQL serves as the secure hosting platform from which the FECC project is deployed.

# Surface 

## The Surface values of the Site

The colour scheme for the site was determined in advance, along with other styling factors such as box-shadowing, font family, style and weight. These were declared as global CSS variables for easy recall. Each variable was prefixed with the project name "--fecc" 

The main color scheme is a variation of blues as primary and greys as secondary colors. For contrast, two shades of red and two shades of green, a yellow and an azure blue are also included. The Font Families were imported from Google Fonts : Roboto and Poppins. Please see the following image for the list of style attributes:

# Credits 

First and Foremost, This Milestone 4 Project was created thanks to the great learning platform and content provided by the Code Institute. While I didn't use much tutor support, when I did need it the tutors were always knowledgable and patient. So a huge credit to the team in Code Institute. Most of this project was built with what I learned from them.

Mr Maranathan Ilesanmi was my Mentor assigned by Code Institute from day 1 and his advice was invaluable. I am very grateful to him for his wisdom and perspective, not to mention his technical knowledge. I wish him all the best for the future. 

For insight on how to approach a django blog build, a YouTube channel "Just Django", run by Mr Matthew Freire from Pretoria in South Africa, provided some very useful elemental processes for me to observe in the project: https://justdjango.com/

### Images 
Some of the photos in the blog website are my own, taken at my workshop.
