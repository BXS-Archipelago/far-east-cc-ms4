## This document will record bugs and how they were fixed. 

1. Getting to the point where I need to use custom CSS and JS, I am getting an error message in the borwser console :
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
net::ERR_ABORTED 404

The Terminal gave this message:
[18/Jul/2021 14:15:39] "GET /static/js/base.js HTTP/1.1" 404 1789
[18/Jul/2021 14:15:42] "GET /static/css/base.css HTTP/1.1" 404 1795 

In not being able to connect with the JS and CSS files, I checked the paths were correct in the project. Checking in Slack, previous students had either not had the correct file paths, or there was a problem with STATIC_URL. However, these were all correct in the FECC project. 

After re-tracing the tutorials, everything was matching the Boutique Ado process with installations and layout. I couldn't find a suitable answer on Stackoverflow as the suggestions were all the same and I couldn't pin down the actual source of the issue. I eventually searched online using "STATIC_URL problems" paired up with the error messages and found the solution.

Time spent on this bug: 1 day.

Solution Snippet: 
# settings.py
"STATIC_URL = '/static/'
This means that static files will be stored in the location http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/ or http://localhost:8000/static/. In order to notify Django of our new top-level static folder, we must add a configuration for STATICFILES_DIRS telling Django to also look within a static folder.

# settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('static')),) # new "

Adding the final line fixed the bug after a long search. 

2. As per previous bug, the Media folder was not presenting images properly. 
Found the answer on Slack. The urls.py file needed updating with :
- from django.conf import settings
- from django.conf.urls.static import static

and adding to the end: 
+ static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

3. CSS issue.  The Collection dropdown menu has a robust Bootstrap css style that won't change easily. In Element.style for dropdown-menu class attached to the Collection Button, the attribute -     transform: translate3d(-5px, 52px, 0px); -  places the box -5px into the screen.  I changed this by adding transform: translate3d(0px, 52px, 0px)!important;  to the custom class .dropdown-menu in the CSS file, knowing that "!important"  is a last resort for styling.
